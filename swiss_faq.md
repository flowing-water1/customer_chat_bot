## Ordering an invoice
If you need an invoice for personal or business purposes, most countries accept an e-ticket confirmation as an invoice. For countries with special requirements, an invoice can be ordered using forms that are available for this purpose.

Using an e-ticket confirmation as an invoice
Your e-ticket confirmation is internationally recognised as a receipt in most countries, including Switzerland, and it can be used for the reimbursement of expenses and for the submission of a tax return.

You can order your e-ticket confirmation in your profile under “Bookings” via the link “E-documents (Invoice)” or via the link “​Passenger Receipt”.

Ordering an invoice after your booking
If you find out at a later date that you require an invoice, we can send you a new booking confirmation free of charge up to 90 days after the ticket/document has been completely used. After this 90-day period, we charge a fee of CHF 30 for each confirmation (up to a maximum of five e-ticket confirmations).

Invoices for Greece, India, Italy or Spain
For flights originating in Greece, India, Italy or Spain, we can issue special invoices on request. You can request an invoice in these countries if the information provided on your e-ticket is not deemed sufficient.


## Credit Cards

Card Security Number
 

To make your payments with credit or debit cards online even more secure, we require you to enter the card security number for online bookings. This code will check the validity of the credit/debit card information.

 

American Express

If you are using an American Express Card the security number is the 4 digit number shown above the credit card number on the front of the card.

MasterCard

If you are using a Mastercard (credit card or debit card) the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.

Visa

If you are using a Visa card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.

Diners

If you are using a Diners card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.

## Card Security

Payment security standards
Based on a new EU directive on payment services, we have increased our payment security standards, which ensures an even safer environment for online transactions across European countries.

We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which defines the rules for how we store, transmit and process payment data, particularly with regard to credit and debit card transactions. This also means that all your payment data is encrypted to the highest safety standards.

3-D Secure authentication
To further reinforce security, 3-D Secure authentication is now required for all credit and debit cards that are issued in the EU Economic Area (EEA). This additional step of authentication guarantees secure payments and reduces the risk of fraud.

How does the 3-D Secure process work?
If you haven't done so yet, you will have to register your credit and debit card for this process.

Register via the website of the bank which issued your credit or debit card. This process can vary from bank to bank.
To complete your transaction, you will be redirected to the bank's website for this additional authentication, if 3-D Secure applies to your payment.
Falls Sie weitere Fragen zur Registrierung Ihrer Karten für 3-D Secure haben, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an Ihre Bank.
If you have any further questions about the registration of your cards for 3-D Secure, please contact your bank or card issuing company directly.


## Pay per invoice
Who can use "Pay per invoice"?
You must be over 18 years old and be a resident of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein. Furthermore, this payment option is only available for flights from Switzerland.

What exactly does the ID scan check and where does this take place?
The ID scan and comparison with a selfie prevents fraud and ensures that the person who booked the flight is the actual invoice recipient and that there has been no identity theft. For this purpose, you will receive a link via text message to your smartphone. You will be able to upload your documents and identify yourself via this link.

Do I have to carry out the ID scan for every booking?
No, once you have successfully completed the ID scan, you will not have to do it again for a later booking.

Why has my ID scan failed?
Please note the following when carrying out an ID scan: The photographs should be sharp, well-exposed and avoid reflections. Do not cover the documents. Take a recent photograph of yourself.

Can I repeat a failed ID scan?
Yes, if your documents were not recognised, you may repeat the ID scan.

What reasons could there be for not authorising the "Pay per invoice" option?
For "Pay per invoice", our partner POWERPAY carries out an online check. This check may have a negative outcome for a variety of reasons, such as creditworthiness, contradictory information or unpaid POWERPAY invoices. You can find more detailed information about these reasons on the ​POWERPAY website.

How and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice?
Invoices are issued by POWERPAY. You will receive an individual invoice by e-mail after about 24–48 hours. This invoice is issued free of charge. When the individual invoice is paid on time, no charges are incurred. After this, the amounts outstanding from the individual invoices you have already received will be summarised into one account statement. You will receive this statement by post in the form of a monthly invoice approximately in the middle of the following month, together with a paying-in slip. The cost for issuing the monthly invoice is CHF 2.90.

How long is the payment period and how much are the reminder fees for non-payment?
Individual invoice: The invoice must be paid within 15 days of receipt of the e-mail. Payment will be processed via online banking. Payments made at the post office counter incur third-party costs.
Monthly invoice: The deadline for payment is always the end of the month with the paying-in slip.
Is partial payment possible?
Yes, partial payment is possible for both the individual and the monthly invoices. You can decide to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.

When does a reminder fee become due and how much does it cost?
If the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.

How do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket?
This depends on when you make the cancellation.

If the invoice has already been paid, you will receive the corresponding refund by bank transfer.
If SWISS is able to inform POWERPAY of the cancellation before the end of the payment period and if the invoice has not been paid or has only been partially paid, POWERPAY will send you a new individual invoice with the new amount and the new payment period if there is still an amount pending.
If SWISS is only able to inform POWERPAY once the end of the payment period has been reached, and if the invoice has not been paid or only partially paid, the MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with the additional costs of CHF 2.90 minus the amount to be refunded.
 

Do I have to pay the invoice in full before boarding my flight?
No, you can board your flight regardless of whether you have paid your POWERPAY invoice or not.

Do you have any queries about your invoice?
If you have any queries about invoices, please contact POWERPAY’s customer service.

E-mail: info@powerpay.ch

Hotline: +41 58 806 06 22

Customer service is available Mondays to Fridays from 8:00 to 17:00 h.

Can I give my business address for payments?
Purchases on account can only be made on submission of your private address.


## Frequently asked questions: Payment
What advantages do I have if I used the currency conversion option?
Using the currency conversion option gives you the following advantages:

You decide which currency is to be charged to your credit card.
The daily exchange rate is displayed, and is guaranteed for the payment.
Credit card companies usually charge an additional fee for purchases in foreign currencies (foreign currency fee). This does not apply if you pay in the currency of your credit card.
 

Who can benefit from the currency conversion option?
The option to pay in a different currency is available only when booking through swiss.com.

The service cannot be used to change flights, for later upgrades or additional services (e.g. additional baggage item etc.) or for ticket purchases made through different booking channels. These are charged in the original currency of the departure airport.

What exchange rate is used for the conversion?
The total converted amount is based on the daily exchange rates of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Please note that the exchange range can therefore vary for new bookings or booking enquiries made through swiss.com.

The exchange rate at the time the booking is concluded is definitive. It will appear both on swiss.com and on the confirmation.

Will there be any other credit card charges?
Some banks might charge additional fees in individual cases. SWISS has no influence over these charges.

What currency is used for refunds?
Rückerstattungen finden immer in der Währung des ausgestellten Tickets statt.


## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept
Can a particular Economy fare be fully booked?
No. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .

Can the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?
The fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.

Why doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?
Group bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.

Can the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?
The additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.

Is it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?
Wenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.

What do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?
Tarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.

What do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?
Im Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.

What are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?
The number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.

If I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?
Like the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.

If I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?
No; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.

What is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?
The 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.

The first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.

If I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?
No; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.

How many additional items of baggage can I purchase?
You can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.
